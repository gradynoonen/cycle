Touch-enabled transitions are more complicated than non-touch enabled transitions, because touch interactions are inherently more complicated than click interactions.\r\n\r\nThere is an option to allow the developer to emulate touch events by clicking-and-dragging, making integrating touch support into new transitions easier.\r\n\r\nTouch-capability tested on Android 2.3 and iOS 4+.\r\n\r\nFeedback is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\njQuery Cycle Plugin\r\n===================\r\n\r\nCycle is an easy-to-use slideshow plugin that provides many options and effects for creating beautiful slideshows.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\n* [Home Page](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/)\r\n* [Options Reference](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html)\r\n* [Effects Browser](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/browser.html)\r\n* [Download](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/download.html)\r\n","name":"Cycle","google":""}
