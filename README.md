Touch Integration
===================

Integrating touch-compatibility requires a number of user-settable new options, and some modification/addition to core functionality in cycle.

A sizable amount of code used in integrating Touch events exists within individual transitions, therefore some work has to be done to enable non-touch enabled transitions to be touch-friendly. Touch-enabled transitions are more complicated than non-touch enabled transitions, because touch interactions are inherently more complicated than click interactions.

There is an option to allow the developer to emulate touch events by clicking-and-dragging, making integrating touch support into new transitions easier.

Touch-capability tested on Android 2.3 and iOS 4+.

Feedback is greatly appreciated.
