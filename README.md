Touch Integration
===================

Integrating touch-compatibility requires a number of user-settable new options, and some modification/addition of core functionality in cycle.

A sizable amount of code used in integrating Touch events exists in individual transitions, therefore some work has to be done to enable previous transitions to be touch-friendly.

Hopefully, I'll find a place to host the demos soon. As they exist now, you should be able to download the project and run them locally.

Touch-capability tested on Android 2.3 and iOS 4+.

Feedback is greatly appreciated.
